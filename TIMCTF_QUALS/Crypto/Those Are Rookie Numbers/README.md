===== Info =======

I overheard a discussion about whether the size really matters. What does this have to do with RSA?

===== End of Info ======

We were given the following:

```
n = 58900433780152059829684181006276669633073820320761216330291745734792546625247
e = 65537
c = 56191946659070299323432594589209132754159316947267240359739328886944131258862
